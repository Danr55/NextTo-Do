# NextTo-Do

A simple and stylish To-Do List application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and LocalStorage. This app allows users to add tasks, assign importance levels (Urgent, Important, Not Important), and store tasks in the browser's LocalStorage so they persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task and add it to your list.
- **Importance Levels**: Assign tasks an importance level (Urgent, Important, Not Important).
- **Task Removal**: Delete tasks from your list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are saved in LocalStorage, so they persist across page reloads.
- **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: Beautiful, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.

- **Delete Task**: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
- **Persistence**: The tasks will remain stored in LocalStorage, so even if you refresh the page, your tasks will stay intact.
